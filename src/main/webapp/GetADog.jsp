        How to get a dog?
    </h1>
    Two ways: <br>
    <h2>Option 1: Adopt a dog (Recommended!)</h2>
    There are thousands of dogs in Israel looking for a home! In fact, only in "Tnu Lahiot Lihiot", there are around 300
    animals, many of them being dogs, that are in need of adopting every day! So how can you help? <br>
    Well, it's really quite easy. First, find the dog shelter closest to you
    (<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Dog+shelters&oq=dog+shelter&aqs=chrome.0.69i59j69i57j0i271l2j69i60l3.3510j0j9&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8">this</a>
    link might help!). Depending on the shelter, you might need to pass a simple interview process. As long as you're a
    normal
    person, this shouldn't be a problem. Then, find a dog you like. In order to take it home, you'll probably have to
    pay a small
    fee. This isn't a payment for the dog, but rather a way to make sure the shelter has enough money to keep taking in
    dogs
    who need homes.
    <h2>Option 2: Buy a purebred dog</h2>
    Some people want a purebred dog, and that's fine too!
    There are a many dog breeds, each different from the other in size, color, personality etc. Make sure you get a
    dog from a breed you'd like! In addition, purebred dogs can be quite pricey, so if you are willing to pay the price,
    at least make sure the dog has an official certificate for being purebred.
    <br><br>
    Either way, once you get a dog, give it a good home and lots of love! your dog will be your best friend,
    so treat it well!

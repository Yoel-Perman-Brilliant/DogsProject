<h1>Five reasons why you should get a dog</h1>
<h2>1. Dogs are really, really cute.</h2>
<p>
    This might be obvious to say, by this is the truth: Dogs are adorable, which is only one of the many reasons why
    they are so fun to have in home.
</p>
<h2>2. They become a part of your family</h2>
<p>
    This might take a while, but I promise you that if you get a dog, it will be a treasured family member.
    For example, when somebody calls me and asks me if I'm home, I never say I'm alone - I'm with my dog, whom I love.
</p>
<h2>
    3. They make you go outside
</h2>
<p>
    Even though it can be a chore, taking your dog on a walk is beneficial both to your dog - since it allows them to
    pee - but also for you. Even when you're stressed, or you feel down, taking a walk with your dog is sure to
    make you feel a little better.
</p>
<h2>
    4. They have different personalities
</h2>
<p>
    Some might say that they're not fit for a dog, maybe because they are home too much, or they are not active enough.
    <br> Well don't worry, since not matter what your personality is, there is a dog who will fit it. For example,
    if you are an energy-filled person who enjoys taking trips, there are lots of dogs that will enjoy being active with you.
    But if you prefer staying home with a cup of tea, you might be more interested in a dog like mine, who loves to sleep
    more than you at 6:30 on a Saturday.
</p>
<h2>
    5. They teach you responsibility
</h2>
<p>
    Taking a care of a dog is a huge responsibility: Making sure they're never hungry or thirsty, taking them out
    several times a day and cleaning up after them are no easy tasks. However, they teach you about what it's like to
    care for somebody and take responsibility. And somewhere deep inside your heart, you have a soft spot for it - since
    all you do is help out your adorable friend, who loves you more than anything else in the world.
